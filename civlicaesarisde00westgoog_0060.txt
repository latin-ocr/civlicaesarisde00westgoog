The art of laying out camps, called castrametation, was
really a department of religious ritual, a branch of the
augural science, just as was the laying out of
new cities and the planting of colonies. The
camp, being a place where the auspices were
taken, was itself a tenplum, a consecrated space of ground
with tixed limits. The cardo and decumanus, the cross lines
of a templum, were found in the two main streets of the
camp, meeting in its centem* where the
augurdculum was situated at the com·
mander's quarters, the proterium. There
was the altar on which the general sacri-
ficed for the army, and the sorum in which
the soldiers assembled when he addressedv
them. Thus the religiousand the politi-
cal side of the life of the community
were represented, and the camp wasa
symbol in miniature of the home city-a
temporary provisional fatherland for the citizens during
their foreign service.

The choice of a site depended, however, on purely mili-
tary considerations. A place was selected hymen sent in
advance, where, if possible. water, forage, and
woodl were easily obtainable, preferably on
a slight elevation‚ where the rear of the camp could be at

θ The city of Chester, England, is perhaps the most conspicuous exam-
ple of a town preserving the outlines of a Roman camp. Its walls are
nearly complete, and it is divided into quarters by two main streets at
right angles, with gates at their ends.

l Getting water (aquatio) and fodder for the horses and mules (pabu-
ldrid) were among the duties that could ordinarily be assigned to the cav-
alry and the auxiliaries. Wood was used also, not only for fuel but iu

the construction of the ramparts.
