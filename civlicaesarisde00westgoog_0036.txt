him entirely. His mind was so clear that his heart was
somewhat cool* Many men worshiped him, none really
knew and loved him. He used men as instruments in the
far-reaching plans which he alone understood, and though
he rewarded them justly, even generously, be could not
have real associatos, real friends. A man so great must
always live alone in the world. Thus Caesar stands, in soli-
tary eminence, the supreme representative man of action
in the world's history.

Such is theman who still speaks to us from these pages.
What is his manner of speaking? Some men, without much
to say, write for the sake ol saying things in a
line style. He had much to say, and does not
seem to trouble himself much about his man-
ner ol saying it. He had the same natural command of
language as of everything else he needed to use. His
narrative is like clear glass: we see through it and are
hardly conscious ol it-alter we learn to read Latin, oi
course-and just for that reason we may easily make a
great mistake, and fail to see that this is the hnest possible
style, for he shows us his thoughts perfectly without mak-
ing us think of his words. There is in Caesar's writing that
kind oi beauty that does not depend on orna-
ment, which depends rather on perfect propor-
tion-that is, perfect fitness or suitableness of
manner to matter. The language is so plain that we might
almost call it bald; it is always quiet and temperate3 the
descriptions are spirited, but never strained; the speeches
· are brief, manly, businesslike; the arguments calm and
convincing; everywhere it is the language oi a man writ-
ing with the easy grace-one might almost say the care·

lessuess-of perfect skill.
