CHAPTER 1 PAGtt 1

1. Gallia: see map‚ frontispiece. The term Gallia, as here used,
excludes Cisalpine Gaul and the province, but includes most of the Neth-
erlands, the country on the„west bank of the Rhine, and much of Switzer-
land, and thus extends far beyond the limits of modern France.

est. . . divisa: is divided, not has been dividrd; this is not a true
perfect tense, but a present, divisa being a predicate adjective; W. 293;
B. 337; A. ²91· ὸς H. 394. t. When you look up agratnmar reference be
careful to notice the examples. They will often be of more help than the
statement of a mle.

omnis: taken as a whole.

quarunt: partitive genitive; W 355; B. 201. 1 ; Α. 216. a. 2 ς H. 440. 5.

¹ unam: sc.‚ partem. It is best in translating this sentence to change to
the passive construction, in order to preserve more nearly the order and
emphasis of the Latin; thus: One of which is inhabr'ted by tlte Bel-
gians, etc.

2. Belgae: the population of Gaul was much mixed even in Caesar's
day. successive hordes of invaders of Celtic rece and language had been
coming into the country for several centuries‚ conquering the earlier in-
habitants, intermarrying with them, and, except in the south, imposing
their language upon them. These Celtic conquerors were a tall, fair race3

· the populations which preceded them were shorterand darker. The con-

quering rnce were most numerous in the northern partos Gaul, and were
less modified by mlxing with the earlier inhabitants They were the
latest coniers and the least civilized of the Celts. But they were much
mixed with German tribes in the northeast. See Ek. 11, ch. 1.

aliam: the second, lit. another.

Aquitani: Iberians, a short. dark people‚ living on both sides of the
Pyrenees. They were but slightly mixed with the conquering Celtic race,
and retained their own language.

qtti: those who; the antecedent of qui is ei understood, the subject of
incolunt.

3. Celtae: in the great central division of the country the population
was more mixed than in Aquitania, and less purely Celtic than in Belgic
Gaul. The language was Celtic. and the physical characteristics of the

Celtic racc were common enough to make a decided impression upon
foreign observers.

Galli: the people of the great central division of Gaul—Gauls‚ in the
narrower sense of the word.

4. lingua: ablative of specificati0n; W. 396; B. 2263 Α. 253: H.
