xxx INTRODUCTION

The bearer oi the eagle, the standard oi the legion, attend-
ed him, and he was responsible for its saiety and honor.

The junior centurion oi the same maniple and cohort
was called primus pilus posterior. ,

similarly the two centurions ol the second maniplo oi
the first cohort were called primus princeps prior and primus
princeps posterior.

Those oi the third maniple oi the first cohort were prt-
mus hastatus prior and primus hastatus posterior, aud so on
throughout each of the ten cohorts. Thus, those oi the
third maniple of the tenth cohort were thederinus hastatus
prior and decimus hastatus posterior.

It is clear that the highest oi the 60 centurions was

the primus pilus prior (or primipilus), and that

the lowest was the decimus irostdtus posterior3
but the order oi promotion from rank to rank
is not known.

Each centurion was assisted by a subordinate, called
an optio because he was appointed, chosen
(opto) by the centurion.

Certain oi the centurions highest in rank, called cen-
torrionis primorum ordinum, or brieily primi ordr'ne's, took part
in councils oi war. These may have been
either the ten first centurions oi the respec-
tive cohorts, or the six centurions ol the first
cohort. Probably centurions who had attained this rank
and, alter being discharged, had returned to serve as vol·
unteer veterans (e'oo'cdtr') were also included in the primi
ordinis. ι

d. As to the regular number oi soldiers in a legion, we
can not speak with certainty. Caesar’s legions at the battle
oi Pharsalus in the Civil War, in 48 a. e, aiter
all the campaigns in Gaul, averaged 2,75o men
each; two, in particular, a little later had
dwindled to about r‚600 rnen each; ior the
losses of warnere not often made good by incorporating
