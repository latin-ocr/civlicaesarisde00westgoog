oi the enemy, and to grapple the two ships fast and, board-

There were no longer such fleets as there had

been—e. g, in the first Punic war, when the

war-galleys were counted by the hundred. A

galley propelled by oars, corresponding to a modern stearn

war-ship, was called navis langa. The rovvch, who were
slaves chained to their benches‚ were arranged in one or
more banks or tiers. They worked in shilts‚ probably four

hours at a time. A large galley most commonly

Qum had three banks of oars (natvs triremis) one

above another, and the rowers were protected by the dcck

extending the whole length oi the vessel. The working
crew consisted oi a few seamen, needed to manage the sails
and the steering. The latter was done by means oi two
long sweeps or oars projecting backward one on each side
oi the stern. The fighting crew was a detachment oi sol-
diers temporarily drafted from a legion. Transports (aazias
oneraria) for men or merchandise were shorter
and broader‚ and depended on sall-power alone.

A galley also had masts and sails, but they would be cleared

away on going into action (expedire narrem).
