in earlier times had nearly passed out ol existence, and
the numerous cavalry employed by Caesar consisted almost
entirely oi foreign allies and mercenaries, Spaniards, Gauls,
and Germans.

a. Only Roman citizens* regularly had the right to
serve in the legions, In the good old times this service
had been considered a privilege as well asa
duty. ln those days wars had lasted hutone
or two seasons, and the enlistments but lor a
short time. But loreign conquests and civil
wars had resulted in lreeping up large permanent armies,
and the soldier had become more and more a professional.
Especially had this been true since the time ol Marius, who
had not only introduced many changes and improvements
into the service, but had opened the ranks to the lowest
class oi the citizens not previously allowed to enlist, and
in general had done more than any other man to encourage
the growth ol a military class separate in leelings and in-
terests from the mass ol the citizens. The soldier was no
longer a patriotic citizen serving a lew years in the army

as a part ol his civic duty and privilege, but a

professional who had taken up arms as a career.
‘ He expected to spenu tle prime of us ure in
the ranks, and at his discharge alter twenty
years to have a provision made lor his old age. His inter-
ests were no longer mainly those oi the state, but those ol
his commander, on whom depended all his personal hopes
Thus the military system ol Caesar's time was very similar
to the “spoils system '' in our politics.

b. Lilre the regiments in modern standing armieS, the
legions were distinguished by numbers in the order ol their
enlistment. Thus, under Caesar’s command in Gaul, we

was extended to Cisalpine Gaul in u. c. 88. The (fifth) legion Alauda was
enrolled by Caesar in Further Gaul athis own expense. Citizenship was
asterward given to its members by him.
