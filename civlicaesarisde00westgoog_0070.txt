CHAPTER ΙΙΙ

CAESAR'S PROVlecES

The word prouincia in Latin meant the field oi duty or
activity assigned to a particular magistrate. When in the

third century a. c. Rome began to conquer and
„ govern foreign territories, these lands were

organized as regular dependencies ol the Re-
public under magistrates sent out to rule them, and were
called “provinces’'-prtiuincioe. The earliest governors
were praetors, whose number was increased in order to
provide provincial governors Later, irom the time oi
Sulla, all the praetors were needed at Rome to preside
over the various courts. It then became customary to
prolong the imperium of magistrates after their year of
office at Rome expired, and to send them out as pro-con·

suls or pro-praetors to govern a province for a year.
The more important provinces were assigned to pro-con·
