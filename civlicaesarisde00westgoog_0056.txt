The severest test of the soldiers was the endurance ol
their long marches‚ when lully burdened with baggage.
The heavy pieces ol baggage (r'mpedimenta)-·
spate arms, leather tents‚ clothing, and lood
supply—were transported in wagons or on
pack-animals(r'12menta) driven by the servants (calones). But
there was still a great deal left to be carried by the indi-
vidual soldier. The personal paclr was called
sarcina. lt consisted oi iood for three to lii-
teen days, and each man's share oi cooking utensils (rusa),
large stakes for the camp palisade (zullr or sullis), saws,
baskets‚ spades, axes, and other tools. Each man's burden
amounted to about sixty Roman pouuds, (Roman pound
=.72 English pound.) The kit ol the modern soldier
weighs about the same as that oi the Roman soldier.

Marius had invented amethod ol making a bundle ol ·
the articles to be carried, and lastening it to a lorlted sticlt,
which was carried over the shoulder-—this stielr,
or the soldier thus loaded, was called mulus
Marianus (“Marius's mule ''). The soldiers
were trained in time ol peace by practise marches‚ The
