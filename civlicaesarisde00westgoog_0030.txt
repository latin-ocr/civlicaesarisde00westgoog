AFTER CONSTRUING

bonu CAESAR, when you sternlyuwrote

The story os your grim campaigns,
And watched the ragged smohe·wreath float
Above the buming plains,

Amid the impenetrable wood,
Amid the camp’s incessant hum,
At eve, beside the tumbliug dood

ln high Avaricum,

Tou little reched, imperious head,
When shrilled your shattering trumpet’s noise

Your srigid sections would be read
By bright-eycd English boys.

Ah me! who penetrales today
The secret oi your deep designs?

Your sovereign visions as you lay
Amid the sleeping lines?

The Mantuan singer pleading stands;
From century to century

He leans and reaches wistiul hands,
And cau not bear to die.

But you are silent, secret, proud,
No smile upon your haggard lace,

As when you eyed the murderous crowd
Beside the statue's base.

I marvel: that Titanic heart

Beats strongly through the arid page,
And we seli-consciens sons of art

In this bewildering age,

Like dizzy revelers stumbling out
Upon the pure and peacesul night,
Are sobered into troubled doubt,
As swims across our sight

The ray oi that sequestered sun,
Far in the illimitable bluc-
The dream os all ou leit undone,
Os all you dated to do. ι
