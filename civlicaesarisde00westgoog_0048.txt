now 'only as officers (tribuni). The J. '

cavalry in Caesar's time consisted of 1

auxiliary or mercenary troops. He em· φ

ployed large numbers of friendly Gauls,

and later, when he learned their excel-

lence, ol Germans. 3There may have

been a small number of troopers regularly enlisted in the

legions-not large enough, however, to be of much impor-
tance in battle.

When organized in the Roman manner, cavalry was
formed into regiments (alce). Each tila, commanded by
a prefectus, consisted normally of twelve
troops (tumme), each turma of three squads
(decuriae) of eleven-i. e., ten men and their commander
(decurro). Thus, an dla would contain (12 >< 33) 396
troopers.

Not very much value was attached to cavalry in
the actual shock of battle; but it was used by Caesar

with immense effect for scouting and out-

aarum

ΠΜ post duty, for reconnoitering‚ ior protecting
cmm the flanks of the infantry in battle or on a
march, and, most of all, in completing the destruction of
a defeated enemy by a prompt and energetic pursuit.
In this use of mounted troops Caesar and Napoleon were
alike.
