lxii INTRODUCTION

bonne. This country had been a province lor sixty years,
was peaceful‚ and largely Romanized. Besides the Roman
colonies there were some ancient Greek settlements, espe-
cially the important city ol Massilia (Marser'lles), within its
boiders.

3. Illyricum, adjoining Cisalpine Gaul on the east and
extending down the eastern coast of the Adriatic. This
was a source of strength to Caesar, and gave him no trouble
during the term ol his office.

The military lorces under his command at the hegin-
ning consisted ol iour veteran legions;* the number was
increased from time to time until it reached
ten or eleven. As to the auxiliary troops
employed we have little information. The raising ol addi-
tional troops when needed was included in the powers ol a
provincial governor by virtue oi his inperium. Moreover‚
the territories hordering on his province were considered a
fair field for his ambition‚ and his reasons ior entering
upon a foreign conquest which extended the irontiers of
Rome‘s empire were not osten very closely scrutinized.

Gaul meant at different times Cisalpine Gaul, Trans· ⁴
alpine Gaul, the “Province'’ or Free Gaul, not yet sub-
duee, or in a narrower sense the central divi·
sion of the latter, the land oi the Galli or Celtae
proper, excluding Aquitania on the south and
Belgic Gaul on the north.

The Gauls were not one nation in the modern sense ol
the word, but rather a large numberl ol small nations or

nis Foroea
