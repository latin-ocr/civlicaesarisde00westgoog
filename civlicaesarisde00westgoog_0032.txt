that the longest thanksgivings ever decreed were voted as
the news came, year after year, how Caesar was not merely i
defeating but subjugating the¹ terrible Gauls, and even
carrying his victorious banners into the shadowy realms of
the Germans and Britons.

Thus Caesar waxed while Pompey waned3 faces turn

friends and reckon with his enemies.

Long ago he reckoned with his enemies and then passed
away to his own account, but the thoughts of men have '
been busy with him ever since. His name has
become an imperial title, and the greatest

‘¹ Why, man, he dorh bestride the narrow world
Like a Colossus: and we petty men ,

Walk under his huge legs . . .’'
