AFTER CONSTRUING

Lonn Cfflk, when you sternly wrote
The story ol your grim campaigns,

And watched the ragged smoke-wreath float
Above the burning plutius,

Amid the impenetrable wood,
Amld the camp’s incessant hum,

At eve, beside the tumbling flood
ln high Avaricum,

You little recked, imperious head,

When shrilled your shattering trumpet's noise
Your frigid sections would be read ¹

By bright-eyed English boys.

Ah mel who penetrates today
The secret os your deep designs?

Your sovereign visions as you lay
Amid the sleeping lines?

The Mantuan singer pleading stands;
From century to century

He leans and reaches wistlul hands,
And can not bear to die.

But you are silent, secret, proud‚
No smile upon your haggard face,

As when you eyed the murderous crowd
Beside the statue's base.

1 marvel: that Titanic heart

Beats strongly through the arid page,
And we seli-consciens sons of art

ln this bewildering age,

Like dizyy revelers stumbling out

Upon e pure and peaceful night,
Are sobered into troubled doubt,
As swims across our sight

The ray oi that sequestered sun,
Far in the illimitable blue-

The dream ol all you test undone,

Os all you dared to do. ι
Α. C. ansow.
