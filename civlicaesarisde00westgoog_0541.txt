Tua cauas Wxa ron Granio lunaruwosxcs„ Before tire close of
the winter, cenain Gallie tribes having revolted, under the leadership of
the Arvernian Vercingetorix, Caesar returns in haste frorn Italy, invades
the country ol the Arverni, relieves the Boii, and captures three cities in the
center of Gaul (ch. 1-13). The Gauls having resolved, as a military
measure, to destroy all their towns which could afford strongholds to the
Romans, spare Avaricum in the land of the Bituriges„ Caesar besieges
it, captures it after a long and heroic resistance, and to teach the patriota
a severe lesson‚ destroys it. The policy of Vercingetorix is justified by
the fate of Avaricum (ch. 14·31). The next great struggle was about
the stronghold of Gergovia, in the Arvernian country (ch. 32-52). This
Caesar fails to take, and having found the Haedui treacherous, conducts
an expedition against thern and sends Labienus against the Parisii (ch.
53-62). Uniting again with Labienus, Caesar defeats Vercingetorix, who
retreats to the hill of Alesia in the district of the Mandubii (ch. 63-67).
Caesar invests the place. The Gauls nearly all over the country join the
revolt and raise an army for the relies of Alesia. By elaborate siege·
works Caesar succeeds in hemming in the town completely and in defend-
ing his own rear. When the final struggle carne against both the be-
sieged and the vast army ol relief, the genius bf Caesar and the disciplined
heroism of his army triumphed over the tremendous numbers and wild
courage ol the enemy? With the fall of Alesia and thc surrender ol
Gaul’s ablest leader perished the last reasonable hope of its independence

(ch. tit-oo).
