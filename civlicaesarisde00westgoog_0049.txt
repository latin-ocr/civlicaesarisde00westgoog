CAESAR'S ARMY xxxix

The auxiliary infantry was not organized into legions,
but only into cohorts‚ which, owing to the ancient practice

Ι , of stationing them on the wings of an army in
*unm line of battle, were commonly called cohortes
mmm oldrr'ae. Each cohort had a Roman commander
(prascctus). The auxiliary infantry plays but an insignifi-
cant part in Caesar’s campaigns. It was useful, however,
in impressing the mind of the enemy with the
appearance of larger numbers and in relieving
the legionaries of many duties of a campaign other than
those of actual fighting.

Besides the regular auxiliary infantry there were from

. time to time separate bodies of allies, the con-
ἔξω ti tingents of friendly states, or mercenaries,

gum Μ serving under their native chiefs and organ-
ized in their native manner. 1

3. Officers of tlte Line and Staff*

Besides the company officers, centurionis and optriine‘s,
there were the legion officers (trt'brini), six to each legion.
The tribunes had formerly been in command of
the legion by turns-two at a time-but their

duties were now mainly administrative. They were of
-equestrian rank-Roman knights-and most of thern were
merely serving in the army for a short time to advance
their political fortunes, so that they were of little real
value to the general. Caesar's legions were, as a rule, each
Imm commanded by lieutenants (le'gctti) of sena

torial rank-men of experience, and mostly
efficient officers. Α le'gdtus was sometimes given an inde·
pendent command (imperium) over several legions, forming

tubunas

⁴* Officers of the “line’' are connected with and command particular
bodies of troops or parts of them. Staff-officers, on the other hand, are
attached to the commanding general to assist him, and are not perma-
nently connected with definite portioris of the army.
