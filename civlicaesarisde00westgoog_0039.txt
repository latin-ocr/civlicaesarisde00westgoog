find the rst, 6th, yth, 8th, 9th, roth, 11th, 12th, 13th, 14th,
and 15th legions*

A legion was more like a brigade than a regiment of
a modern army. It was divided into ten cohorts (bat-

talions), each oi which consisted oi three mani-
ples (companies). The maniple was the small·
est separate unit oi organization, but it was
divided lor tactical purposes into two centuries, called
ordinis (platoons). The maniple was a permanent body,

but the men in each ordo might vary irom day to day.
ThuS, in inverse order:

2centuries= rmaniple;
6 centuries = 3 maniples = r cohort;
60 centuries = 30 maniples = 10 cohorts = 1 legion.

The men ol the first maniple oi each cohort were called ·

trr'cirii (or piloni ); those ol the second maniple, principem
those ol the third, hastati. These names had formerly sig·
nified three kinds oi legionaries, who lormed the rear line,
the second line, and the ioremost line respectively, in
battle order. Now they were merely names ior the three
maniples oi each cohort and ior their centurions. The
centurions were the ¹‘ non-commissioned '¹ officers who had
risen irom the ranks.
c. The senior centurion ol each maniple commanded the
whole maniple; the junior was his subordinate—they did
not have independent commands, each ol a
ΤΗΝ· century. The senior centurion oi the first
ww maniple oi each cohort, in like manner, com-
emmm · mandeti the whole cohort.

Thus, there weresixtycenturionsinalegion,
with a regular order of rank. The senior centurion ol the
first maniple of the first cohort, called primus pilus prior
(or primipilus), not only commanded his own maniple and

cohort, but directed the movements oi the entire legion.

⁴ Later, under the Empire, the legions had names as well es numbers.
