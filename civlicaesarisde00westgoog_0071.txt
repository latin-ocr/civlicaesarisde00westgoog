legal or political rights except such as the conquering
Republic might choose to allow them. In lact, however,
the administration oi local affairs aud minor matters ol
law was generally leit in the hands ol the native authori-
ties. For the administration ol higher justice the pro'v-
inees were divided inlu circuits or districts rn which the
governors periodically held court. Free and allied cities
or Roman colonies‚ ii there were any within the limits ol
a province, were independent in most respects ol the gov-
ernor's jurisdiction.

It was usual lor the Senate to assign, a year in advance‚
two provinces tothe two consuls who might be elected

lor the year about to begin. Alter their elec-

vim tion they cast lots to determine which prov·

inee each should take; alter their year ol

office at Rome was over they proceeded to their provin-

cial governments. The assignment ol Caesar's provinces ’

was exceptional. It had been agreed by the mernbers ol

the Triumvirate that Pompey was to have the Spains,

Ι Crassus Syria, and Caesar the Gauls lor live years, and
their arrangement was afterward legally ratilied.

The provinces finally assigned to Caesar by a special
law, first for five years, afterward ior tive more (58-49 a. c),
were:

r. Cisalpine Gaul, the northern part of Italy, but not
yet politically incorporated with it, a prosperous and peace·
lul country with a large and vigorous popu·
lation‚ lrom which Caesar drew most ol the
troops needed during the Gallie War. Gallie
conquerors had long ago settled in this region, aud had
been subdued by the Romans about 200 ae, and since
that time many llourishing Roman cities have been planted
iu the country.

2. Transalpine Gaul, the “Province ” as it was called,
a name which survives in the French provence, or Gallia
Narbo‘nc'nsis, so called from the capital Narbo, now Nar-

caeaar’s
