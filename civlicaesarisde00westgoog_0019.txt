CAESAR ix

able soldier, but totally incompetent as a statesman. He
had won renown by conquering Jugurtha, king of Numidia,
and had saved Rome by annihilating the vast
hosts of the northern barbariam, the Cimbri
and Teutons, who had defeated several Roman armies and
threatened to destroy the city, as the Gauls had done nearly
three centuries before.

Marius’s younger rival, the champion of the nobles, was
Sulla, who had managed to get a large share of the credit
of the Jugurthine War, and who won fresh fame
by his conquests in the East. Equal to Marius
as a soldier, he surpassed him infinitely in political sagacity.
He had the clearest notions of what he wished to accom-
plish, indomitable energy, and no scruples to interfere with
his relentless policy.

These two men, their political followers, and their ruf·
fian troops for 'several years were by turns in power, and
repeatedly drenched Rome with the blood of thousands of
her citizens. ·

Marius died in his seventh consulship, worn out by toil,
by age, by excitement. Then· Sulla ruled with an iron
hand until he finally laid aside his power and retired into
private life. After his death his political arrangements
were mostly swept away, and things went on much as
before.

There were, however, no more civil struggles marked
by the ferocity of the contest of Marius and Sulla. The

Ι nation was somewhat tamed by loss of blood.
m mm One cause of trouble had been removed: the
3¹23? discontented allies in Italy, by their successes in
y the “ Social War,'' ⁴* had forced Rome, though
finally victorious in the field, to grant them citizenship.

The latter demanded independence or else equal rights as citizens of
Rome.
