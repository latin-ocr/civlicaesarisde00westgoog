CAESAR'S ARMY xlvii

day's march in war was regularly about sixteen rniles
(iasmm iter). Foreed mai-ebes (πῆμα mucra)
were sometimes as long as
twenty-five miles, or even a little more.

parties o( cavalry and by certain picked rnen, speeially
trained sor the duty, called explffra'mm or spetuldffiris. The
main body, consisting ot the legions, had several methods

the legions marched in single column, each with its own
baggage-train following—the hindmost legion detachlng
one or two cohorts to come last of ally behind its baggage,
and [σῃ-ιι the rear-guard (novissimum agrum).

When there was some reason to expect attacks by the
enemy, the greater part o( the legions went first without
their baggage-trains (expedttoe); then followed the baggage
os the whole army, and last came as rear-guard the re-
mainder os the legions⁴ This ordery reversed, was followed
upon aretre'at. The march in battle array was the only
une where the individual men were ready for immediate
fighting and were (expediti) without their packs (sarcina)v
