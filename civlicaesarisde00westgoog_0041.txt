CAESAR'S ARMY xxxi

reenforcements into old legions. Recruits were rather en-
rolled in new legions, so there was the greatest difference in
the experience as well as the numbers of different legions.
It was several years before a legion was called “ veteran.''
New recruits were called tirones. In Caesar's time a newly
raised legion numbered 5,000* or 6,000 men. Taking
3›⁶00i as the average number available for duty through
the seven years of the Gallie War, we should then have
cohorts of 360, maniples of 120, centuries of 60 men each.
The effective strength was of course continually lessening
by losses through battle and sickness, though this was
partly offset by the increase in skill and experience.

e. The enlistment was for twenty years, at the end of
which the veteran expected to be rewarded with a bounty
in money, or a small piece of land, or both.
Sometimes colonies of veterans were founded
in conquered territory, as outposts of Roman
authority. Some of these colonies developed into cities
which are important to-day.

Service was by law compulsory on all citizenS, but the

earned, more than sufficed to fill the legions.

s. The pay of a legionary, about equal to the earnings of
alaborer, was fixed by Caesar at ²²5 denarii a year,1 with
deductions for food and equipment. The sol-
dier was better off than the laborer, in that
his shelter was furnished him.

{Some authorities say 6,000‚ which would make each century contain,
asiis name implies, 100 men. But it seems as if in fact the number was
not generally so large.

lllfany writers upon the tactics of fighting and marching talre these
numbers as the basis of their calculation.
