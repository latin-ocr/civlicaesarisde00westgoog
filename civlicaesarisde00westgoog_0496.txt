24. Rhenum transire: it can not be detennined with complete cer-
tainty where Caesnr's bridge was built; most probably it was somewhere
between Coblenz (Confluentes) and Andemach. There is, moreover, a
strong reason ior thinking that the rout oi the Usipetes and Tencteri was
near the junction oi the Rhine and Moselle. There are also arguments in
favor ol B0nn as the site os the bridge. Mr. T. Rice Holmes‚ in his Cae·
sar’s Conquest as Gaul, comes to the conclusion that this bridge, as well
as the second one described in Bk. VI, ch. 9, was “built between Ander-
nach and Coblenz.” This opinion has received strong confirmation by the
discoveries and excavations of Nissen and Koenen. below Urmia, a vil..
lage midway between Andemach and Coblenz, an account of which was
published in Caesare Rheinsestung (Sandarabdruck aus Banner Jahr-
bacher, Hesi 104).
