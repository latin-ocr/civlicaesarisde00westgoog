CHAPTER 33

16. legionibus tribus: oue legion was left at Atuatuca with Cicero,
three each went with Labienus, Trebonius, and Caesar. This accounts
for all ten. Hence the twelve cohorts left to guard the Rhine bridge
(ch. 29) must have been withdrawn, or the legions must have been incom-
plete, or those cohorts must have been auxiliary or supenrurnerary troops
The first alternative seems less likely in view of what is said at page 162,
lines 11-14.-—-21. Scaldim: the Scheldt does not now tlow into
the Mense (Maas); the Sambre docs; hence though the MSS. all say
Scaldim, many editors think Caesar made a mistalre and therefore write
Sabim. lt appears, however, that a ferr centuries ago there was a connec-
tion between the Scheldt and the Old Mense (Oude Meas) near the island
of 'Pholon—24. quam ed diem: feminine, because lt means date
