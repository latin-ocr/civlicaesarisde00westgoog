that they might learn something oi the wonderful language
which Caesar wrote and spoke with his countrymen. It has
generally been thought that we can not be well educated
without some knowledge of Latin. I tear, however, that
most of these boys have had so much trouble with their
Latin that they have iorgotten Caesar,a11dI wish it might
nothe so with those who read these pages.

v. Cesar< ns nn Aurrron

Asa writer of Latin prose Caesar was equal to Cicero,
and as an orator he was second to Cicero alone in the time
that is called the Ciceronian age. And no third

mr„ ⁸¹¹ is to be named with these two.

u Caesar's various writings relate to a wide
range ol subjects, for he wrote on divination, on astronomy,
audon grammar; he edited a collection oi Roman witti-

, · cisms; composed a political pamphlet and sev·
⁸¹⁸ mm. eral poems; wrote letters and delivered ora-
m' tions, which were collected and published;
besides his most important works, the ten books oi Com-
mentaries-seven ⁴* on the Gallic and three on the Civil War.
These last are all that are now extant, except a few sen-
tences from his speeches,a few short letters,a few witty
remarks, an anecdote or two, and six lines oi verse about
the Latin comic poet Terence.

We have reason to be thankiul that it is the military
memoirs that survive, because we think of Caesar as a man
who did things rather than as a man who said

Μ things, though lew ever said things so well.

,Ἕω But it is ol value beyond price that we have
&gt his own account oi what he was doing in the

most eventful years oi his lite, and ol how

and why he did it.

ἥ The eighth book ol the Gellic War was written, nol by Caesar, but
by Aulus Hirtius, one os his officere. It is therefore nol included in this
volume. '
