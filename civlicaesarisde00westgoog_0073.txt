CAESAR'S PROVINCES lxiii

tribes in various degrees of independenee, some oecupying
commanding positions among their, neighbors, others in the
position ol clients or dependents ol the larger communi·

ties thus forming various groups within the
ω ⁶²¹¹st limits ol the country. But there was a great
Tm religious assembly every year under the presi·
dency ol the Druids, the priestly order, for the regulation
oi the affairs of all the Gallie peoples, held in the land
ol the Carnutes, which was considered the geographical
center oi the whole country. From time to time there
were lilrewise gatherings of several tribes lor military pur-
poses, and in the seventh year ol the war there was a con·
gress representing nearly all the nations ol Gaul, when
they combined to make a final eliort lor national independ-
ence, and elected a common leader, the hero Vercingetorix.
In general, however, their laelr of harmony, their mutual
jealousies, their unsteadiness ol purpose made thern the
victims ol Caesar’s invariable policy‚ which was the carry·
ing out ol Rome’s ancient maxim, Diotlleet inpuro, ‘⁴ Divide
and conquer.”

The Gauls were the chiel representatives ol that great
race known in history as the celts, which the Greeks and
Romans had only begun to distinguish irorn
the Teutonie race. They had been active in
Europe ior some centuries; they had settled all over what
is now Franco, including Belgium, much ol Holland, Switz-
erland, and western Germany; they were found in the
British Islands, where they still appear in the Irish, the
Welsh, and the Scottish Highlanders; they had settled in
the north ol ltaly, had overrun the peninsula, and had
destroyed Rome itsell in 390 n. c.; they had invaded
Greece; a large number had settled in Asia under the
name ol Galatians; and, finally, forming part of the great
host ol Cimbri and Teutones, they had threatened the
existence oi Rome again just at the time ol Caesar’s birth,

until the peril was averted by the great victories ol Marius.
