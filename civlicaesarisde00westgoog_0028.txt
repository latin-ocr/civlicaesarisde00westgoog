AFTER CONSTRUING

Lonn CAEsAtt, when you sternly wrote
The story of your grim campaigns,

And watched the ragged smoke-wreath float
Above the burning plains,

nmid the impenetrable wood,
Amid the camp's incessant hum,
nt eve, beside the tumbling flood

In high Avaricum,

You little recked, imperious head,

When shrilled your shattering trumpet’s noise
Your frigid sections would be read ·

By bright-eyed English boys.

Ah me! who penetrates to-day
The secret ol your deep designs?

Your sovereign visions as you lay
Amid the sleeping lines?

The Mantuan singer pleading stands;
From century to century

He leons and reaches wistlul hands,
And ean not bear to die.

But you are silent, secret, proud,
No smile upon your haggard lace,

As when you eyed the murderous crowd
Beside the statue's base.

1 marvel: that Titanic heart

Beats strongly through the erid page,
And we sels-conscious sons of art

In this bewildering age,

Like dizzy revelers stumbling out
Upon the pure and peecelul night,
Are sobercd mto troubled doubt,
As swims across our sight

The ray ol that sequestered sun,
Far m the rllrmttable bluc—

The dream ol att ou left undone,
of all you dared to do.
