SuaJucnrrou or rna Basore Gnurs. Learning that the Belgae, ex-
cepting the Remi, were forming a confederation against the Romans, Caesar
takes the field and fortifies a camp on the Axona (Aisne) River, where he
soon afterward inflicts a crushing defeat upon the allied Belgae. This is
followed by the submission of the city of Noviodunum and the nations of
the Bellovaci and Ambiani (ch. 1-15). When advancing against the Nervii,
Caesar is suddenly attached by them and their allies, and barely escapes
defeat. Altera desperate struggle the Nervii are beaten and almost anni-
hilated (ch. 16-28). The Atuatuci surrender after a siege, but, acting
treacherously‚ are sold into slavery (ch. 29-33). The campaign ends with
the reduction of several tribes along the coast (ch. 34, 35). ’
