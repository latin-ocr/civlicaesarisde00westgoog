BOOK FIVE-B. C. 54

Sucovo invasion or Barrnnv, ch. 1-23. Having resolved upon a
more effective invasion ol Britain, Caesar orders a lieet to be assembled at
Portus ltius, where, after quieting disturbances in Illyricum and settling
a dispute between rival chiels ol the Treviri, he gathers his troops lor the
voyage. Dumnorix, the Haeduan, intending to take advantage ol Caesar’s
absence, deserts on the eve ol his departure, but is pursued and slain.
Landing on the south coast ol England, Caesar puts the natives to flight.
The narrative is interrupted by an account ol the island and'its inhab-
itants. Caesar marches inland in spite ol vigorous resistance, receives the ·
submission ol many tribes, and then retums to Gaul.

Tria Wna wrurr Auaronrx, ch. 24-54. Graiu being scarce, Caesar
divides his army lor the winter. One camp, that ol Sabinus and Cotta, is
attached, and by treacherous promises ol Ambiorix the Romans are in·
duced to leave it. On the march they are destroyed by the enemy. Quin-
tus ¹Cicero, in command ol another detachment, when similarly attached,
defends himself gallantly until he is rescued by Caesar's advance to his
relies. The proposed attaclr on the campos Labienus is abandoned for
the time, but almost all Gaul is stirred up. Later Indutiomarus attacks
Labienus, but is defeated and slain. The episodes of this season are the
most exciting in the whole narrative ol the Gallie War.
