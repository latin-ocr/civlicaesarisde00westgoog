CAESAR

iii. Cmsxu's Crrxuxcrux

Caesar was tall and elegant in figure, of a fair complex-
ion, with dark hair and keen, dark eyes His sculptured
portraits give the impression at once ol com-
manding intellectuality and tremendous prac-
tical force*

He was very careful in his dress and in his youth was
something ol a dandy. His long-sleeved tunic, with lringes
at the wrists, his loose girdle and the carelul
arrangement ol his hair, which he sometimes
adjusted with one finger, caused his opponents
to charge him with loppishness, and the less intelligent ol
them to underrate his abilities and his ambition. Even
when advanced in life he is said to have prized the privi-
lege, voted him by the senate, ol always appearing with a
wreath of laurels on his head, chiefly because it enabled
him more effectually to conceal the baldness about which
he was extremely sensitive.

But when on a campaign he allowed himself no luxury
in dress or style ol living, except that he always had the
finest horses. Though not by nature very
strong, he had, by the severest discipline,
trained himself to excel in military and ath·
letio exercises, and to endure the utmost hardsbip and
latigue. His tastes were elegant but simple. In matters
ol e'ating and drinking he was so temperate that his bitter-
est loe, Cato, said, with characteristic sarcasm, that of all
who came to overthrow the republic, Caesar
alone came sober.

He had remarkable strength and skill in
swimming, and could ride a spirited horse with his arms
folded behind his back. His ability to use weapons served

seems to represent the soldier, one in the Brltish Museum in London which
