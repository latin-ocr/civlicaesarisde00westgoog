murum . . . fossamque: Caesar, of course, did not run a wall and
ditch all the way from Geneva to Pas de l'Ecluse. For much of the dis-
tance the cliffs are steep and fortifications unnecessary. Where the slope
was gentle he cut straight down for sixteen feet, and, throwing the earth
toward the river, made a kind, of wall and rnoat. See sectiou opposite
page ὁ. This was on the south bank of the river. He had to fortify in
this way only about three miles of the nineteen. With the number of
rnen at his disposal this required only three or four days.
