CAESAR xxv

events, in which the author, speaking of himself in the
third person, tells his story in a quiet, moderate tone that
convinces us oi his truthiulness and lairness. We feel that

the Caesar about whom he tells could hardly
ΗΝ caeff⁸¹ have acted otherwise than he did. We are ias-
ffikm cinated by the power oi the man—a power

marvelously balanced and perfectly controlled.
Nothing was too delicate ior his exquisite tam, and nothing
so difficult but we always leel he might have done even
more, had it been necessary. Usually his means seemed
insufficient to accomplish his purposes‚ but then it was
Caesar that was using them.

The chief interest, then, of the Commentarios is that

they show us this man at his work-organizing armies,

⁸ making alliances, outwitting his foes by wily
gnffm diplomacy, or fighting likea heroos romance
m ω in the front oi battle; asan efficient adminis-
trator, a strategist bold to audacity, a tactician never ata
loss for an expedient in novel circumstances, an engineer
ol infinite inventiveness, an unerring judge oi men.

But he never boasts of his own doings; he does not
abuse or underrate his foes. His lieutenants he praises
&mm generously where praise is due3 oi their faults

hc speaks with charity. Humbler members oi
his own army and unknown Gauls have had their gallant
deeds immortalized by his pen.

lt was next to impossible to deceive him. He seemed
always to understand men’s hearts He tells
of his enemies' acts without apparent indig-
nation‚ and generally makes us feel that they were in the

. ι wrong.
gum With all his calm generosity toward other
hirsaugiam„ men, we do not find in him a moral greatness
corresponding to his mighty mind. He was not
good in the same sense that he was wise. lt is impossible
to admire him too much, but also it is impossible to trust
