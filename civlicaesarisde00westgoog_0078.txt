tant members ol that body. Italians flocked in· large num·

authors, 3ηά poetS, and Gauls even became Roman emper·

Empire, various German nations earne in and established
their supremacy. Most important ol these were the Franks,
who gradually extended their power over the country, and
gave it their own name, the “Realm ol the Franks,”
France. But the language ol France is Latin
still, and the people are mainly Celtic. In the
brilliant history ol this great country we can
traee the Gallie character, but through it all
runs the strong, deep impression ol Roman influence.
French cities bear the names ol ancient Gallie tribes, and
the dioceses ol French bishops largely preserve the ancient
boundary-lines ol those tribes. But French civilization is
Latin rather than Celtic, and the French are right when
they begin with Caesar in the text-books ol their history.
Behind Napoleon and Louis XIV, behind Charlemagne and
Clovis, twenty centuries away stands Caesar, tirst and great-

Neu-Caesareo, and at the university which bore lor a hun·
